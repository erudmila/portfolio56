<h2>As the marking period comes to a close, It's time to reflect on my Web and App development skills so far. </h2>

    <h3>DISCLAIMER!</h3>
    <p>My portfolio will increase its contents as the year goes on. Unfortunately, last year our class made a big change from Replit to GitHub, so a lot of projects were lost.</p>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
   <p>
The first marking period of our Web and App Development class has been a great start, beginning with a review of the concepts we learned in 11th grade, which helped solidify my understanding of the basics like HTML, CSS, and Python. This review laid a strong foundation and made me feel more confident with web development fundamentals. As we move forward, Iâ€™m excited for the more advanced topics ahead,  app development and project management, which will challenge me to expand my skills further. The first marking period has shown me just how much more there is to learn in this field, and while we've only scratched the surface, I'm eager to dive deeper into building more complex projects and gaining hands-on experience in user experience, interactivity, and app design.</p>
