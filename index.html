          <p>Hello we are Team Quartet! We created this app with one question in mind: 
          How can we empower high school students to transition smoothly from high school to college or the workforce with the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence? </p>
      <p>We are excited to present the app we have been working on called Next step! Our app is not just another tool; it's a comprehensive platform designed to help high school students plan for their futures. Next Step is there too help students find certain opportunities for what they might want to do after high school,
allow students to fill out a survey for things they're interested in, in order to give them appropriate options for what they want to do.
The target users that our app will address are students in high school or students who have graduated high school.
We'll delve into the inspiration behind our app, explore its unique features and discuss our vision for its impact on students' lives.
