    <div class="project-caption">This project was a part of the Pencil-Infosys Infy App challenge. Our app is a comprehensive platform to help high school students plan their futures. Next Step is there to help students find certain opportunities for what they might want to do after high school, allow students to fill out a survey for things they're interested in, in order to give them appropriate options for what they want to do. This competition was really fun to participate in. We got to learn so much through our mentors who helped us each week, and weekly delverables that helped us keep track on our progress.   </div>

    <div class="project-caption">Project stem is a platform we used in 11th grade to learn more about Python. Unfortunately, Since this was last year the class dashboard has been lost. After each unit, we would do a fun assignment! The platform helped my skills in Python drastically and it was educational. </div>
